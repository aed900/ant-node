//! Proof-of-concept regression test for the **bootstrap stall** attack
//! against the neighbour-sync admission / drain detector.
//!
//! ## The attack (no fix yet)
//!
//! While a node is bootstrapping, every inbound `NeighborSyncRequest`
//! whose admission overflows `MAX_PENDING_VERIFY_PER_PEER` (the per-peer
//! cap is the first to bite for any single peer) calls
//! `bootstrap::note_capacity_rejected(source)`. The drain check in
//! `bootstrap::check_bootstrap_drained` then refuses to complete
//! bootstrap while the set is non-empty:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! if !state.capacity_rejected_sources.is_empty() {
//!     return false; // "not yet drained"
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The set entry for `source` is cleared only when **the same source**
//! later completes an admission cycle with zero rejections. A single
//! peer that keeps sending over-cap hints faster than the verification
//! queue drains never has a "clean cycle" — so it is **permanently**
//! in `capacity_rejected_sources`, and bootstrap **never completes**.
//!
//! ## Why this matters
//!
//! While `is_bootstrapping == true`:
//! - **Audits are paused** (`replication::audit::audit_tick` returns
//!   `Idle` if `is_bootstrapping`, see `audit.rs` Invariant 19). A
//!   victim stuck in bootstrap mode is effectively a node that does no
//!   auditing — bad nodes around it accrue no trust penalties.
//! - Other replication invariants gated on `bootstrap_drained` (paid
//!   list repair flow, prune confirmation paths) also stay off.
//!
//! A single Byzantine peer in the victim's routing table can therefore
//! disable the entire reputation system on that victim, for free,
//! using nothing but well-formed `NeighborSyncRequest` messages that
//! the victim's admission path accepts as legitimate.
//!
//! ## What this test proves
//!
//! Drives the in-process pieces (`ReplicationQueues`, `BootstrapState`,
//! `bootstrap::note_capacity_rejected` /
//! `bootstrap::check_bootstrap_drained`) end-to-end through the same
//! call sequence that the live replication loop runs when handling an
//! over-cap `NeighborSyncRequest`. This test documents the buggy shape by
//! asserting the victim does not drain *within the test's sub-second window*.
//!
//! Update: the stall is now BOUNDED (not permanent) by the per-source
//! re-deliver TTL + absolute deadline in `replication::bootstrap`
//! (`CAPACITY_REJECT_REDELIVER_TTL` / `BOOTSTRAP_MAX_DURATION`). The
//! bounded-completion guarantee the fix requires is asserted by the
//! `stalled_capacity_rejected_source_cannot_block_drain_forever` and
//! `bootstrap_force_completes_at_absolute_deadline` unit tests in
//! `bootstrap.rs`. This test is retained as the attack-shape marker.
